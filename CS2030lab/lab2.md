# Lab 1 Recap

- Get used to connecting to plab server (using WinSSHTerm)

- Get used to gvim commands, etc.

- Comments are up on codecrunch

# Common Mistakes

Styling

- Generally ok. 
- Try to make it readable (we are reading the code too)
- Use gg=G command (Demo)

# Lab 2 Brief

Topic Coverage

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Method overriding

# Task

Write a program that reads in the number of cruises in the schedule as an integer, and a list of cruises that will arrive for that day. 

The program will output the loader allocation schedule.

- 2 types of cruises
    - normal
    - big

- 2 types of loaders
    - normal
    - recycled (less useful)

# Levels

1. Representing a normal cruise

2. Representing a normal loader
    - Use loaders to serve cruises

3. Introduce Big Cruises
    - Inheritance and polymorphism.

4. Introduce Recycled Loaders
    - See above

5. Finishing up
    - Same as Lab 1 Level 5

# Level 1: Represent a Cruise

Cruises:

- Takes a fixed 30min for a loader to fully load.

- Requires only one loader for it to be fully served.

# Level 1: Things to do

- Constructor that takes in `String id` and `int arrivalTime`

- Instance method `getServiceCompletionTime()`: 30 minutes after `arrivalTime`
    - \textsmall{Cases to consider}
    - \textsmall{130 + 30 = 200}
    - \textsmall{145 + 30 = 215}
    - \textsmall{Hint: Abstract into a private function}

- Overriden `toString()` method (next page)

# Level 1: Output format

- `cruiseCode@arrivalTime` string representation of a cruise
   - `arrivalTime` must be formatted as a 24h time

- Hint: Use `String.format("%04d", arrivalTime)`
    - E.g. `String.format("04d", 23)` returns `"0023"`

# Level 2: Represent a Loader

Loaders:

- As many loaders are used to serve a cruise as required.

- Cannot serve another cruise until the current service is done.

- Output a list of cruises it has served.

# Level 2: Things to do

- Constructor that takes in `int id`
    - \textsmall{Hint: Consider using a \type{static int} as counter.}

- Instance method `serve(Cruise cruise)`: serves a cruise
    - \textsmall{Does the loader need to know what cruises it has served?}
    - \textsmall{Does the loader need to know when is the next available time?}

- Overriden `toString()` method (next page)

# Level 2: Output format

```
Loader id serves:
    cruise1@hhmm
    cruise2@hhmm
    ...
```

# Level 3: Big cruises

- Needs \(X\) loaders \(0 \leq X \leq 9\)

- Needs \(T\) service time. \(0 \leq T \leq 99\)

- Use inheritance
    - What new information is there?

# Level 4: Recycled loaders

- Takes a 60 min break **after** each service.

- Every third loader is recycled.
    - Loader 1
    - Loader 2
    - Loader 3 (recycled)
    - Loader 4
    - ...

# Level 4: Things to do

- Inheritance again
    - What's new?

- Override `serve(Cruise)`: the next available timing is the cruise's service time + 60 minutes

# Level 5: Putting it together

- Start with no loaders

- For each cruise, find the first available loader

- If there are not enough loaders, purchase a new loader
    - \textsmall{Every 3rd loader is recycled}
