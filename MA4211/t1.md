> Show \(\R^\N\) does not have a countable basis.

Following hint for each \(x\in\R\) we look at the vector
\[ v_x = (1, x, x^2, x^3,\dots)\]
and we claim that the set \(\set{V_x}_{x\in\R}\) is linearly independent.

Suppose not, then there exists \(c_1,\dots,c_n\) coefficients such that
\[c_1 v_{x_1} + \dots + c_n v_{x_n} = 0\]
but this implies that \(v_{x_1}, \dots, v_{x_n}\) are linearly dependent,
in particular this Vandermonte matrix
\[ \begin{pmatrix}
1 & x_1 & x_1^2 & \dots & x_1^{n-1} \\
1 & x_2 & x_2^2 & \dots & x_2^{n-1} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & x_n & x_n^2 & \dots & x_n^{n-1} \\
\end{pmatrix} \]
has determinant \(0\) despite \(x_i \ne x_j\) for all \(i\ne j\).

\(\ell^\infty\) is definitely equivalent to neither \(\ell^1\) or \(\ell^2\).

Constant bound between sum and sum of square seems impossible as number of summands, despite being finite, is still unbounded.

In fact from [this stackexchange post](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/439220/what-is-the-difference-between-square-of-sum-and-sum-of-square)
sum of squares is below sum squared which is below n sum of squares.

obvious

positive check, definite check, scalability follows from that of \(\abs{-}\) and properties of integration,
triangle also follows from abs on \(\R\) and properties of integration.

trivial

(a) too hard

(b) by geometric intuition if \(U = V\) then \(\lVert P \rVert = 0\) otherwise \(1\)

(c) too hard
