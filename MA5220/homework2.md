> Show that if \(\alpha\cdot\alpha =\beta\cdot\beta\), then \(\alpha = \beta\).

Without loss of generality assume \(\alpha < \beta\), as ordinal multiplication
is weakly monotonic over its left argument we have
\[ \alpha\cdot\beta \leq \beta\cdot\beta \]
ordinal multiplication is strictly increasing over the right operand so we have
\[ \alpha\cdot\alpha < \alpha\cdot\beta \]
compose inequalities to get \(\alpha\cdot\alpha < \beta\cdot\beta\).

> Assume CH. Show that \(\paren{\omega_n}^\omega = \omega_n\) for every \(1\leq n < \omega\).

I need a better picture of cofinality to solve this...
