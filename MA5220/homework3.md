Let the cardinalities of the sets in the sequence be \(\omega\leq \kappa_1 < \kappa_2 < \kappa_3 < \dots\),
then we can easily obtain a sequence where \(Y_i\subseteq X_i\) and \(\abs{Y_i} \ne \abs{Y_j} \implies Y_i \cap Y_j = 0\).
This can be achieved by doing

* for all \(i\) where \(\abs{X_i} = \kappa_1\), set \(Y_i = X_i\),

* for each \(n > 2\), for all \(i\) where \(\abs{X_i} = \kappa_n\),
  set \(Y_i = X_i \setminus\bigcup\set{X_j: \abs{X_j} \leq \kappa_{n-1}}\).

Hence without loss of generality we can assume that in the sequence, sets of different cardinalities do not intersect.
By refining the resultant sequence at each cardinality,
we can reduce to the case where all the \(X_i\) are of the same size \(\kappa\).
Then it suffices to prove that given a sequence \(\angle{X_n:n<\omega}\) of subsets of \(\kappa\) where
\(\abs{X_i} = \kappa\) for all \(i\), we can create a disjoint refinement.

\newcommand{\acc}{\operatorname{acc}}
Given two sequences \(A = \angle{A_n:n<\omega}\) and \(B = \angle{b_n:n<\omega}\)
we let \(\acc(A,B) = \angle{A_n\cup\set{b_n}: n<\omega}\).

Define \(f:\kappa \to {}^\omega\kappa\) by

\begin{align*}
f(0) &= \angle{\set{\min(X_0)},0, 0, \dots} \\
f(n+1) &=
\left(
\begin{aligned}
\textbf{ let } D &= \bigcup \range(f(n)) \\
y_0 &= \min(X_0\setminus D) \\
y_1 &= \min(X_1\setminus D\setminus\set{y_0}) \\
y_2 &= \min(X_2\setminus D\setminus\set{y_0,y_1}) \\
&\dots\\
y_{n+1} &= \min(X_{n+1}\setminus D\setminus\set{y_0,y_1,\dots,y_n}) \textbf{ in }\\
 &\acc\paren{f(n), \angle{{y_0},{y_1},\dots,{y_{n+1}},0,0,\dots}}
\end{aligned}
\right)
\end{align*}
whenever \(n<\omega\),
\[ f(\alpha)(i) = \bigcup_{\beta<\alpha} f(\beta)(i) \]
whenever \(\alpha\) is a limit ordinal and \(i<\omega\), and
\begin{align*}
f(\alpha+1) &=
\left(
\begin{aligned}
\textbf{ let } D &= \bigcup \range(f(\alpha)) \\
y_0 &= \min(X_0\setminus D) \\
y_{n+1} &= \min\paren{X_{n+1}\setminus\paren{D\cup\set{y_0,y_1,\dots,y_n}}} \textbf{ in }\\
&\acc\paren{f(\alpha), \angle{y_i: i<\omega}}
\end{aligned}
\right)
\end{align*}
whenever \(\alpha\geq\omega\).

Finally let \(Y_i = \bigcup_{\beta<\kappa} f(\beta)(i)\) and the pairwise disjointedness and containment properties arise from construction.

For each \(n<\omega\), we see that \(f(n+1)\) is well-defined, as \(\abs{D} < \omega \leq \abs{X_i}\) for any \(X_i\).
Next we see that in the sequence \(f(\omega)\), each \(f(\omega)(i)\) has size \(\omega\),
this observation also completes the proof in the case \(\kappa=\omega\).

For any \(i<\omega\) we want to show that \(\abs{\alpha} \geq \abs{f(\alpha)(i)}\) for all \(\alpha\geq\omega\).
Proceed by induction and the successor case is obvious.
When \(\alpha\) is a limit, then
\[
\abs{f(\alpha)(i)} = \abs{\bigcup_{\beta<\alpha} f(\beta)(i)}
= \abs{\alpha}
\]
as each \(\abs{f(\beta)(i)} \leq \abs{\beta}\leq\abs{\alpha}\).
This means \(f(\alpha+1)\) is also well defined for any \(\alpha\geq\omega\) as \(\abs{D} \leq \abs{\alpha} < \kappa\).

Note that we are in the case that \(\kappa>\omega\) and we still need to prove that for each \(i<\omega\), \(\abs{Y_i} = \abs{\kappa}\),
it suffices to define an injective function \(g: \paren{\kappa\setminus\omega} \to Y_i\),
which we can do by defining \(g(\alpha)\) to be the only element of \(f(\alpha+1)(i)\setminus f(\alpha)(i)\).

> Use transfinite induction to construct \(X \subseteq \R^2\) such that
> \(X\) intersects every line in \(\R^2\) at exactly two points.

Let \(<\) be a well ordering of lines in \(\R^2\) with the order type exactly \(\abs{\R}\)
and \(\prec\) a well ordering of points in \(\R^2\).

Suppose \(l\) is a line and at stage \(l\),
\(X_l\) is a set of points satisfying

* no 3 points in \(X_l\) are colinear,

* \(l'<l\) implies \(l' \in L(X_l)\) the set of all lines generated by points in \(X_l\).


First note that for any line \(l\), let \(Y_l = \bigcup L(X_l)\) denote the span
and we have
\[ \abs{Y_l \cap l} = \abs{\bigcup_{l'\in L(X_l)} l'\cap l} \leq \abs{L(X_l)}
\leq [X_l]^2 < \abs{\R} = \abs{l} \]
whenever \(l\notin L(X_l)\).

Then we define \(X_{S(l)}\) as

* if \(l \in L(X_l)\) then \(X_{S(l)} = X_l\),

* if \(l\cap Y_l \ne 0\) then choose a minimum point \(a\in l\setminus Y_l\) and set \(X_{S(l)} = X_l\cup\set{a}\),

* if \(l\cap Y_l = 0\) then choose two minimum points \(a,b\in l\setminus Y_l\) and set \(X_{S(l)} = X_l\cup\set{a,b}\),

and when \(l\) corresponds to a limit ordinal, then define
\[ X_l = \bigcup_{l'<l} X_{l'}. \]

We start the induction by setting, where \(m\) is the minimal line \(X_m = 0\),
and notice that the invariant is preserved throughout.

Define \(X\) as the final union and observe that no 3 points are colinear in \(X\),
otherwise they would occur in some \(X_l\).
Also all lines are taken care off so \(X\) intersects every line at exactly two points.

\(\lambda\) obviously cannot be finite,
suppose \(\lambda\) is singular, then it cannot be a successor cardinal so it
has to be a singular cardinal.
We can decompose \(\lambda\) (in a fashion similar to Homework 2 Q2\) as
\[ \lambda = \bigcup_{\eta<\cf(\lambda)} X_\eta \]
where the union is disjoint, and each \(\abs{X_\eta} < \lambda\).
We can verify by chasing elements that
\[ {}^\lambda\kappa = \prod_{\eta<\cf(\lambda)} {}^{X_\eta}\kappa \]
and at each \(\eta\), we have \(\abs{{}^{X_\eta}\kappa} \leq \kappa\)
which can be used to get the bound \(\kappa^\lambda \leq \kappa^{\cf(\lambda)} = \kappa\)
as \(\cf(\lambda) < \lambda\). This is a contradiction.

Following hint, let \(\lambda\) be the least cardinal such that \(2^\lambda > \kappa\).
Let \(\prec\) be the following linear order on \({}^\lambda 2\):
\(f\prec g\) iff \(\paren{\exists \alpha<\lambda}\paren{f\restrict \alpha = g\restrict \alpha \land f(\alpha) < g(\alpha)}\).
Let \(D\) be the set of all \(f\in{}^\lambda 2\) such that \(f\) is eventually \(0\).
For \(f\in {}^\lambda2\), let \(A_f = \set{g\in D: g\preccurlyeq f}\).

First let \(f, g\in{}^\lambda2\) where \(f\prec g\), and we want to show that \(A_f \subsetneq A_g\).
The containment is clear as \(h\in D, h\preccurlyeq f\implies h\preccurlyeq g\).
Case \(g\in D\) then clearly \(g\notin A_f\),
when \(g\notin D\) let \(\alpha<\lambda\) such that \(f\restrict\alpha = g\restrict\alpha\) and \(f(\alpha) < g(\alpha)\),
let \(\beta>\alpha\) be minimal such that \(g(\beta) = 1\), we produce \(h\in D\) by
\[
h(\gamma) = \begin{cases}
g(\gamma)&\text{if }\gamma < \beta\\
0&\text{if }\gamma \geq \beta
\end{cases}
\]
and note that \(f\prec h\) because \(h(\alpha) = g(\alpha)\), also \(h\prec g\) since \(g\notin D\),
this shows properness of containment.

Note that since \(\kappa < 2^\kappa\), \(\lambda \leq \kappa\).
In addition, by definition we can see a natural injection from \(D\) into \(\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda} {}^\alpha2\),
and for each \(\alpha<\lambda\), we have \(2^\alpha \leq \kappa\) by minimality of \(\lambda\).
Then \[ \abs{D} \leq \abs{\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda} 2^\alpha} \leq \kappa \]
and let \(i:D\to\kappa\) be injective.

Define \(F:{}^\lambda2\to\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\) as \( f\mapsto i(A_f) \) which is injective, so \(\abs{\operatorname{range}(F)} = 2^\lambda > \kappa\).
For any \(i(A_f), i(A_g) \in \operatorname{range}(F)\), we have \(A_f\subseteq A_g\) or \(A_g \subseteq A_f\) and this property is still preserved after taking the image of an injective mapping,
so \(\operatorname{range}(F)\) is a family with size at least \(\kappa^+\) satisfying the property.
We let \(\mathcal{A}\) be any subset of \(\operatorname{range}(F)\) with size exactly \(\kappa^+\) and complete the proof by making the observation that
the property still holds for any infinite subset of \(\operatorname{range}(F)\).
