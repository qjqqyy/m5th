Let \(<\) be a well ordering of lines in \(\R^2\) with the order type exactly \(\abs{\R}\)
and \(\prec\) a well ordering of points in \(\R^2\).

Suppose \(l\) is a line and at stage \(l\),
\(X_l\) is a set of points satisfying

* no 3 points in \(X_l\) are colinear,

* \(l'<l\) implies \(l' \in L(X_l)\) the set of all lines generated by points in \(X_l\).


First note that for any line \(l\), let \(Y_l = \bigcup L(X_l)\) denote the span
and we have
\[ \abs{Y_l \cap l} = \abs{\bigcup_{l'\in L(X_l)} l'\cap l} \leq \abs{L(X_l)}
\leq [X_l]^2 < \abs{\R} = \abs{l} \]
whenever \(l\notin L(X_l)\).

Then we define \(X_{S(l)}\) as

* if \(l \in L(X_l)\) then \(X_{S(l)} = X_l\),

* if \(l\cap Y_l \ne 0\) then choose a minimum point \(a\in l\setminus Y_l\) and set \(X_{S(l)} = X_l\cup\set{a}\),

* if \(l\cap Y_l = 0\) then choose two minimum points \(a,b\in l\setminus Y_l\) and set \(X_{S(l)} = X_l\cup\set{a,b}\),

and when \(l\) corresponds to a limit ordinal, then define
\[ X_l = \bigcup_{l'<l} X_{l'}. \]

We start the induction by setting, where \(m\) is the minimal line \(X_m = 0\),
and notice that the invariant is preserved throughout.

Define \(X\) as the final union and observe that no 3 points are colinear in \(X\),
otherwise they would occur in some \(X_l\).
Also all lines are taken care off so \(X\) intersects every line at exactly two points.

\(\lambda\) obviously cannot be finite,
suppose \(\lambda\) is singular, then it cannot be a successor cardinal so it
has to be a singular cardinal.
We can decompose \(\lambda\) (in a fashion similar to Homework 2 Q2\) as
\[ \lambda = \bigcup_{\eta<\cf(\lambda)} X_\eta \]
where the union is disjoint, and \(\eta<\xi<\cf(\lambda)\) implies
\(\abs{X_\eta} < \abs{X_\xi}<\lambda\).
Now it is clear that
\[ {}^\lambda\kappa = \bigcup_{\eta<\cf(\lambda)} {}^{X_\eta}\kappa \]
which gives
\[ \kappa^\lambda = \sup_{\eta<\cf(\lambda)} \kappa^{\abs{X_\eta}} \]
Then \(\kappa < \kappa^\lambda\) means that there is some \(\eta<\cf(\lambda)\)
such that \(\kappa < \kappa^{\abs{X_\eta}}\), but \(\abs{X_\eta} < \lambda\) contradicting minimality.
