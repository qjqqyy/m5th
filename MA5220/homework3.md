Let \(<\) be a well ordering of lines in \(\R^2\) with the order type exactly \(\abs{\R}\)
and \(\prec\) a well ordering of points in \(\R^2\).

Suppose \(l\) is a line and at stage \(l\),
\(X_l\) is a set of points satisfying

* no 3 points in \(X_l\) are colinear,

* \(l'<l\) implies \(l' \in L(X_l)\) the set of all lines generated by points in \(X_l\).


First note that for any line \(l\), let \(Y_l = \bigcup L(X_l)\) denote the span
and we have
\[ \abs{Y_l \cap l} = \abs{\bigcup_{l'\in L(X_l)} l'\cap l} \leq \abs{L(X_l)}
\leq [X_l]^2 < \abs{\R} = \abs{l} \]
whenever \(l\notin L(X_l)\).

Then we define \(X_{S(l)}\) as

* if \(l \in L(X_l)\) then \(X_{S(l)} = X_l\),

* if \(l\cap Y_l \ne 0\) then choose a minimum point \(a\in l\setminus Y_l\) and set \(X_{S(l)} = X_l\cup\set{a}\),

* if \(l\cap Y_l = 0\) then choose two minimum points \(a,b\in l\setminus Y_l\) and set \(X_{S(l)} = X_l\cup\set{a,b}\),

and when \(l\) corresponds to a limit ordinal, then define
\[ X_l = \bigcup_{l'<l} X_{l'}. \]

We start the induction by setting, where \(m\) is the minimal line \(X_m = 0\),
and notice that the invariant is preserved throughout.

Define \(X\) as the final union and observe that no 3 points are colinear in \(X\),
otherwise they would occur in some \(X_l\).
Also all lines are taken care off so \(X\) intersects every line at exactly two points.

\(\lambda\) obviously cannot be finite,
suppose \(\lambda\) is singular, then it cannot be a successor cardinal so it
has to be a singular cardinal.
We can decompose \(\lambda\) (in a fashion similar to Homework 2 Q2\) as
\[ \lambda = \bigcup_{\eta<\cf(\lambda)} X_\eta \]
where the union is disjoint, and \(\eta<\xi<\cf(\lambda)\) implies
\(\abs{X_\eta} < \abs{X_\xi}<\lambda\).
Now it is clear that
\[ {}^\lambda\kappa = \bigcup_{\eta<\cf(\lambda)} {}^{X_\eta}\kappa \]
which gives
\[ \kappa^\lambda = \sup_{\eta<\cf(\lambda)} \kappa^{\abs{X_\eta}} \]
Then \(\kappa < \kappa^\lambda\) means that there is some \(\eta<\cf(\lambda)\)
such that \(\kappa < \kappa^{\abs{X_\eta}}\), but \(\abs{X_\eta} < \lambda\) contradicting minimality.

Following hint, let \(\lambda\) be the least cardinal such that \(2^\lambda > \kappa\).
Let \(\prec\) be the following linear order on \({}^\lambda 2\):
\(f\prec g\) iff \(\paren{\exists \alpha<\lambda}\paren{f\restrict \alpha = g\restrict \alpha \land f(\alpha) < g(\alpha)}\).
Let \(D\) be the set of all \(f\in{}^\lambda 2\) such that \(f\) is eventually \(0\).
For \(f\in {}^\lambda2\), let \(A_f = \set{g\in D: g\preccurlyeq f}\).

First let \(f, g\in{}^\lambda2\) where \(f\prec g\), and we want to show that \(A_f \subsetneq A_g\).
The containment is clear as \(h\in D, h\preccurlyeq f\implies h\preccurlyeq g\).
Case \(g\in D\) then clearly \(g\notin A_f\),
when \(g\notin D\) let \(\alpha<\lambda\) such that \(f\restrict\alpha = g\restrict\alpha\) and \(f(\alpha) < g(\alpha)\),
let \(\beta>\alpha\) be minimal such that \(g(\beta) = 1\), we produce \(h\in D\) by
\[
h(\gamma) = \begin{cases}
g(\gamma)&\text{if }\gamma < \beta\\
0&\text{if }\gamma \geq \beta
\end{cases}
\]
and note that \(f\prec h\) because \(h(\alpha) = g(\alpha)\), also \(h\prec g\) since \(g\notin D\),
this shows properness of containment.

Note that since \(\kappa < 2^\kappa\), \(\lambda \leq \kappa\).
In addition, by definition we can see a natural injection from \(D\) into \(\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda} {}^\alpha2\),
and for each \(\alpha<\lambda\), we have \(2^\alpha \leq \kappa\) by minimality of \(\lambda\).
Then \[ \abs{D} \leq \abs{\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda} 2^\alpha} \leq \kappa \]
and let \(i:D\to\kappa\) be injective.

Define \(F:{}^\lambda2\to\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\) as \( f\mapsto i(A_f) \) which is injective, so \(\abs{\operatorname{range}(F)} = 2^\lambda > \kappa\).
For any \(i(A_f), i(A_g) \in \operatorname{range}(F)\), we have \(A_f\subseteq A_g\) or \(A_g \subseteq A_f\) and this property is still preserved after taking the image of an injective mapping,
so \(\operatorname{range}(F)\) is a family with size at least \(\kappa^+\) satisfying the property.
We let \(\mathcal{A}\) be any subset of \(\operatorname{range}(F)\) with size exactly \(\kappa^+\) and complete the proof by making the observation that
the property still holds for any infinite subset of \(\operatorname{range}(F)\).
